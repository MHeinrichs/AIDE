What works:
***********

(Testing configuration: Amiga 500+, KS 2.0, 2MB Chip ram)

Disks:
------
- WD Caviar 600 MB
- WD Caviar 202 MB (no LBA)
- WD Caviar 1.2 GB
- WD 10 GB PC fat32 disk (used with fat95 filesystem)
  (identificated as 6 GB because large disks aren't supported by ide.device)
- 8 GB PC disk (I can't remember what type, maybe seagate)
- very old fujitsu with a lot of defects - ide.device successful recover when
  the disk is not responding
(raw transfer rate of tested disks was 400-800 kB/s in depend of block size)


CD-ROMs:
-------
- ACER 2x (max. 250 kB/s)
- TEAC 40x (max. 800 kB/s)
- BTC 40x

Programs:
---------
- AmiCDROM filesystem (KS 2.0+)
- AmiCDFS filesystem (KS 2.0+)
- main HDToolBox functions
- MCDPlayer

Successfully tested:
--------------------
- any combination of disks and CD-ROMs
- transfer of "large" files (40 MB) from one unit ot another without error
  (HDD -> HDD, CDROM -> HDD)
- simultaneous disk accessing by any number of programs
- problemless work with disk when playcd is running
- two CD-ROMs, two CD players (for DJ's :-)
