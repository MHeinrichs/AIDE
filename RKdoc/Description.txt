FILES DESCRIPTION:
-----------------


IDE.DEVICE:
   Software driver.
   Features: two disks support, automatic disk parameters recognition,
             ATAPI support (= you can use a CD-ROM), emulation of basic
             SCSI packets for ATA disks (= you can use HDToolBox
             to create partitions).


---IDEDB.DEVICE: these two removed for now (ml)
---IDEDEBUG:

IDDR <unit = 0 or 1>
   Display informations about the disk in specified unit.

STOPMOTOR [unit]
   Stop the motor of specified disk (or both if no unit is entered).

DRVSPEED <unit> <# of sectors> <offset> <# of loops>
   Display direct read speed of ATA disk.

CDSPEED <unit> <# of sectors> <offset> <# of loops> [yes = random read]
   Display direct read speed of ATAPI CD-ROM.

READDRV <unit> <offset> <# of sectors> <output file>
   Store any sectors of ATA disk to file.

PLAYCD [homedir] [-<unit>]
   CD Player with GUI for OS V37+.
   Features: automatic CD change recognition, list gadget with track names,
         track names stored in files, slider to move to any position
         of the actual track, player window iconification, fast fwd, fast rew,
         jump to next/previous track.
   Usage: set parameter <homedir> to path where directory named "Titles" is
         placed. File with title names is created for each new CD. You can edit
         this file and replace default track names (first line: album
         interpreter, second line: album name, all next lines: track names.
         Icon for iconification is env:playcd.info.

CLIPLAYCD [-<unit>]
   CD Player without GUI (only CLI) for all OS versions.

SCSICMD <device> <unit = 0 or 1> <scsi packet (hex)> [output file]
   Send SCSI packet to CD-ROM and display result.

IDEMOUNT [-auto] [-cd]
   Look for connected disks (CD-ROM) and partitions and create mountlist file
   and starting script. (Note: the idemount is using partitions created with
   HDToolBox). To set which partitions to mount do not use -auto parameter
   or hold left mouse button. Idemount creates ram:mntlist file with all
   partitions mountlist entries and ram:mntstart script. If you want to
   automaticaly mount disk partitions after boot, add these lines
   to startup-sequence:
      idemount -auto
      execute ram:mntstart
   Parameter -cd controls CD drive mounting when "-auto" parameter is included.
   CD mountlist entry is stored in s:idemount.cd0 and is quoted by ^ characters.
   %d string is replaced by unit number.

Note: all commands work only with the ide.device.
