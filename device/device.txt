"Concept" of organisation of files for ide.device:

bin.  This directory holds executables like assembler and linker etc.
lib.  This directory holds "amiga.lib" link library and other "standard"
      or "common" support files
dev.  This directory holds the main part of the amiga exec type device-driver
rdwt. And this directory has the IDE/ATAPI read/write interfacing sub-parts
      of device-driver.

And the directories that select which type of hardware interface is used in
the device-driver:

a500 : The original a500ide interface, that is connected to the side slot of
       Amiga 500.
The following may appear here in the future:
(cfpar: This is for a Compact-Flash memory card (which is used in true-ATA mode) to Amiga Parallel Port adapter.)

To start building a device driver like ide.device or cfpar.device:
EG. if you want an ide.device for a500ide:
1. change current directory to a500
2. type "execute maked". This will start a script that build ide.device

Explanation of the operation of the script follows, and after that an
instance of "a500/maked" script.
(The actual version of "maked" in the a500 directory may change in the future.)
First the two assign commands tie the files (assigns) used in dev.asm and
rdwt.asm to the specific files used in this type of interface, thus making
it possible to select the interface without modifying dev.asm or rdwt.asm
The Amiga include files are needed. Unfortunately these files need to be
acquired separately, these are not public domain.

The binary executables are found one level up in the directory hierarchy and then looking in "bin" directory.
Other files in other directories are found in the same manner.

Finally, the assignments mydevi: and interfacei: are removed to clean up
things a little bit.

<-- begin file "a500/maked" -->
ASSIGN MYDEVI: mydev500.i     ;name of the driver etc..
ASSIGN INTERFACEI: atid500.i  ;macros that access IDE registers

echo "Amiga includes in directory assign i:"
/bin/a68k -ii: /dev/dev.asm   ; main source of exec device
/bin/a68k -ii: /rdwt/rdwt.asm ; read/write routines of device
/bin/dlink -o ide.device dev.o rdwt.o /lib/amiga.lib

assign mydevi: remove
assign interfacei: remove
